It means that we should assign high priority number to the tasks that are dependent by other tasks.\n",

    "The overview of the change: There are two main modification. First one is the change of input data. I add another column that contains the boolean information about whether a task can be multitasked or not. I also add extra small tasks to the dataframe (labeled as \"MUL\"), that are expected to be done simultaneously to the main multitaskable tasks. Second change is the additional case division in the function to print the schedule. If main task is multitaskable, small tasks will be scheduled if its duration is shorter than main task. If its duration is longer than main task, we only execute some part of multitask and let the rest of the multitask back to the heap. It is effective because we do not use any extra time for multitask. The below is the detailed change in our new code.\n",
